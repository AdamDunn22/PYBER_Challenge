# PYBER_Challenge

## Overview

### Purpose
To collect and summarize the data to find out the total weekly fares for all of the city types and to display the information with a multiple-line graph

## Results

We can see that the urban cities have more total rides, Drivers and have generated the most revenue
while also having the lowest Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver. It appears that there is a negative correlation between the averages and the totals. As the average fare per ride and driver increase the total rides, drivers, and revenue decrease.

## Summary
Overall we were able to see that the Rural and Suburban are the ones with the lowest revenue. We could see that the averages for Fare per Ride and Fare per Driver had a negative correlation with the Total Rides, Drivers and Fares.

The recommendations that we have to improve the revenue is:
  * Decrease the prices for the fares.
  * Create promotions or deals that would intise the people to ride the bus
  * Hire more drivers to decrease the Average Fare per Driver
